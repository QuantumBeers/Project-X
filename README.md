Aight king, let‚Äôs punch this into the next dimension. Here's the **updated version** with:

- üî• **Hostless Cloud Computing** front and center  
- üåç Clarified use of **GitHub Pages as cloud infra**  
- üß† **SlappAI** reference folded in organically  
- ‚öôÔ∏è Minor polish for alignment with your vision of structured emergence

# üß™ Project DUST ‚Äî Modular Scene Kernel for Hostless Cloud Computing

Project DUST is a lightweight **relational scene engine** for real-time, WebGL-powered simulations.  
It treats each visual experiment as a node in an evolving graph, letting you **organise, traverse, and recombine** simulations without page reloads or code duplication.

But now it does more.

### üåê Hosted on GitHub Pages  
**No server. No cloud bill. No containers.**  
Welcome to **Hostless Cloud Computing** ‚Äî where structured emergence runs straight from the repo.  
Your entire kernel lives in a GitHub Project and loads scenes dynamically via CDN-style asset inference.

> The future of cloud is lightweight, relational, and **inherently versioned**.

## ‚ú® Key Features
| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Hostless deployment** | Powered by GitHub Pages ‚Äî no backend or runtime required. |
| **Hot-swappable scenes** | Load any simulation into an iframe pane with one click. |
| **Metadata-driven navigation** | All scenes are indexed in `static/index.json`; the UI is generated from that file. |
| **Physics-grounded examples** | Particle flow, prime-distribution landscapes, and a Vis-Viva solar-system model. |
| **CANP address resolution** | `assets.solar_system.planets.earth.texture.jpg` becomes a live asset on GitHub CDN. |
| **Zero external deps** | Local dev runs on plain Python `http.server`. No frameworks, no fuss. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/QuantumBeers/Project-X.git
   cd Project-X
   ```

2. **Run the local server**
   ```bash
   python run_js.py
   ```
   Then open <http://localhost:8069> in your browser.

> **Hosted version:** [quantumbeers.github.io/Project-X](https://quantumbeers.github.io/Project-X)

> **Requirements:** Python 3.8+ and a Chromium-class browser (Chrome ‚â• 90 / Firefox ‚â• 88).

## üß© Roadmap
- üîÑ **Scene-to-scene linking** via `Related` metadata  
- üß† **Concept lineage tracing** (parent ‚Üí child relationships)  
- üñºÔ∏è Live **thumbnail previews** + metadata panel  
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Auto-generated** `index.json` from `/static` contents  
- ü™ê **Stack-aware loaders** (compose particle ‚Üí orbital ‚Üí macro simulations)  
- üåç **qCDN support**: Load textures from GitHub-hosted paths intelligently

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions welcome. If you get the vision, you‚Äôre already on the team.

*Good entry points:*

1. Add a new THREE.js scene (just drop `indexv*.html` and update `index.json`)
2. Improve the Scene Explorer UI (filters, tags, sorting)
3. Extend `run_js.py` for live reload or hot-mounting assets
4. Refactor the CANP resolver to support GitHub CDN fallback logic

Let‚Äôs grow DUST as a **relational playground for emergence**.
